# JS-ChromeExtension
An extension to save important links.
1 - Copy and Paste a link of user's interest, click on copy.
2 - The link gets populated on the list of the app's pop-up.
3 - The link is kept in local storage and thus doesn't get erased on page refresh or chrome session exits.
4 - A button to Delete All links if the user decides so after saving links to an excel sheet fo example.
5 - The Delete All button works with "Double Click" as a way of making sure that the user wants to delete all.
6 - Once the Delete All is double clicked, all the links will be erased from localStorage as well.
